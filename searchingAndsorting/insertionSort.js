// Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
// It works by taking each element from the input and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.
// Starting from the second element, it compares the current element with the previous ones, shifting larger elements one position ahead to make space for the current element.
// This process continues until all elements are sorted.
// Insertion Sort is efficient for small or nearly sorrted datasets and operates in-place without requiring extra memory.

function insertionSort(arr){
    let n = arr.length;
    for(let i=1; i<n; i++){
        let curr = arr[i];
        prev = i-1;

        while(arr[prev] > curr && prev >= 0){
            arr[prev+1] = arr[prev];
            prev--;
        }
        arr[prev+1] = curr;
